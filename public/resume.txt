RESUME PLACEHOLDER - ACTION REQUIRED

This is a temporary placeholder file.

TO ADD YOUR RESUME:
1. Create or export your resume as a PDF file
2. Save it as "resume.pdf" in this same directory (public/)
3. Delete this resume.txt file
4. The "Download Resume" button in the footer will then work correctly

For detailed instructions, see: docs/RESUME_REQUIREMENT.md

Expected file location: public/resume.pdf
Expected download URL: /resume.pdf
Download filename will be: Robert_Robinson_Resume.pdf

NOTE: The resume download button in the footer currently points to /resume.pdf
which will result in a 404 error until you add your actual resume PDF.
